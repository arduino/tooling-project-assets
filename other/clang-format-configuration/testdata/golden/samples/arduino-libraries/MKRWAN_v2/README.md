If you are looking for the firmware running on Murata CMWX1ZZABZ-078 module, the complete source code is hosted at https://github.com/arduino/mkrwan1300-fw

This version of the library tracks https://github.com/arduino/mkrwan1300-fw/tree/master-1.3.1 , which is based on almost clean ST sources.

The firmware update sketch should be flashed accordingly to the MKRWAN_v2 library version in use.
