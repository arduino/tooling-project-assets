# "Check YAML" workflow (Task)

Run [yamllint](https://github.com/adrienverge/yamllint) on the YAML files of the repository.

NOTE: This workflow is focused on linting. Formatting checks for YAML are provided by the ["Check Prettier Formatting" workflow](check-prettier-formatting-task.md), so both should be used.

This is the version of the workflow for projects using the [Task](https://taskfile.dev/#/) task runner tool.

## Installation

### Workflow

Install the [check-yaml-task.yml](check-yaml-task.yml) GitHub Actions workflow to `.github/workflows/`

## Assets

- [`.yamllint.yml`](assets/check-yaml/.yamllint.yml) - `yamllint` configuration file.
  - Install to: repository root
- [`Taskfile.yml`](assets/check-yaml-task/Taskfile.yml) - Linting task.
  - Install to: repository root (or merge into the existing `Taskfile.yml`).
- [`Taskfile.yml`](assets/poetry-task/Taskfile.yml) - Installation task.
  - Merge into `Taskfile.yml`

The code style defined in this file is the official standardized style to be used in all Arduino tooling projects and should not be modified.

### Dependencies

The `yamllint` tool dependency is managed by [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).

Install Poetry by following these instructions:<br />
https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation

If your project does not already use Poetry, you can initialize the [`pyproject.toml`](https://python-poetry.org/docs/pyproject/) file using these commands:

```
poetry init --python="^3.9" --dev-dependency="yamllint@^1.37.1"
poetry install
```

If already using Poetry, add the tool using this command:

```
poetry add --dev "yamllint@^1.37.1"
```

Commit the resulting `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock` files.

### Configuration

If the repository contains generated or vendored files, they can be excluded from the check by adding them to the `ignore` field in the `.yamllint.yml` configuration file.
