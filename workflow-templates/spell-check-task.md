# "Spell Check" workflow (Task)

Use [codespell](https://github.com/codespell-project/codespell) to check for commonly misspelled words in the repository files.

This is the version of the workflow for projects using the [Task](https://taskfile.dev/#/) task runner tool.

## Installation

### Workflow

Install the [spell-check-task.yml](spell-check-task.yml) GitHub Actions workflow to `.github/workflows/`

## Assets

- [.codespellrc](assets/spell-check/.codespellrc) - codespell configuration file.
  - Install to: repository root
- [`Taskfile.yml`](assets/spell-check-task/Taskfile.yml) - spell check and spelling correction tasks.
  - Install to: repository root (or merge into the existing `Taskfile.yml`).
- [`Taskfile.yml`](assets/poetry-task/Taskfile.yml) - Installation task.
  - Merge into `Taskfile.yml`

### Dependencies

The `codespell` tool dependency is managed by [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).

Install Poetry by following these instructions:<br />
https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation

If your project does not already use Poetry, you can initialize the [`pyproject.toml`](https://python-poetry.org/docs/pyproject/) file using these commands:

```
poetry init --python="^3.9" --dev-dependency="codespell@^2.4.0"
poetry install
```

If already using Poetry, add the tool using this command:

```
poetry add --dev "codespell@^2.4.0"
```

Commit the resulting changes to the `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock` files.

### Configuration

If the repository contains generated or vendored files, they can be excluded from the check by adding them to the `skip` field in the `.codespellrc` configuration file.

#### False positives

In the event of a false positive, the problematic word should be added, in all lowercase, to the `ignore-words-list` field of `./.codespellrc`. Regardless of the case of the word in the false positive, it must be in all lowercase in the ignore list. The ignore list is comma-separated with no spaces.
